The aim of this ROS-based Python project is to explore the capabilities of RTK GNSS (Real-Time Kinematic Global Navigation Satellite System) for navigation and conduct a thorough analysis of the collected data. The project employs two GNSS/RTK processing boards, GNSS antennas, and telemetry radios to collect the data. The collected data is then stored in a rosbag format for convenient processing and analysis. MATLAB graph visualization techniques are utilized to gain insights and visualize the results. This integrated approach allows for a comprehensive assessment of the RTK GNSS system's performance and facilitates a deeper understanding of its capabilities in navigation tasks.
